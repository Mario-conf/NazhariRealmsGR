    "safety1_title": "Essential Equipment",
    "safety1_content": "Always carry the 'ten essentials' adapted for the Andalusian environment. This includes navigation (map, compass, or GPS), lighting (headlamp and spare batteries), a basic first-aid kit, sun protection (sunglasses, hat, and sunscreen), and appropriate layered clothing (waterproof and warm layers) for sudden temperature changes. Other vital items are reserve water and food, a whistle, a multi-tool knife, and sturdy hiking boots and socks. In short, pack your backpack with everything you need to be safe and comfortable in Sierra Nevada or any Andalusian route.",
    "safety2_title": "Planning and Meteorology",
    "safety2_content": "Always consult official weather forecast sources (e.g., the AEMET website/app) before you leave and postpone the trip if the weather changes. In Andalusia and high mountains, weather can deteriorate quickly, so stay informed about showers, fog, or storms. Plan the route in detail (kilometers, elevation gain, water points, shelters) and carry maps or a hiking app. It is advisable to inform a family member or friend about your route plan and expected return time so they can alert emergency services if you do not return. For added safety, you can also use mobile apps for mountain assistance (e.g., Alpify, which sends your position to rescue teams).",
    "safety3_title": "Emergency Procedures",
    "safety3_content": "In case of an accident or getting lost, immediately dial 112 (the single emergency number). The operator will ask for your name, a description of the accident (type of injury and number of injured), and the exact location (route, landmarks, and coordinates if possible). Use the PAS protocol (Protect, Alert, Soccor): first, secure the area to prevent further accidents, then alert 112. If there are injuries, provide basic first aid without moving serious fractures. If lost, it is best to stay in a visible location, signal with a whistle or lights, and call rescue again if possible.",
    "lnt_title": "Environmental Regulations and Ethics (Leave No Trace Principles)",
    "lnt1_trigger": "General Regulations in Spain",
    "lnt1_content": "Wild camping is highly restricted: according to Law 42/2007, sleeping is only permitted in designated places (campsites, authorized areas). Generally, setting up a tent or staying overnight without a permit is forbidden outside these sites. In National Parks (like Sierra Nevada), camping without authorization is not allowed. Drone use requires a license and is prohibited in protected natural areas without specific permission. Additionally, Spanish laws protect wild flora and fauna: you cannot damage or collect native plants or disturb protected animals. Hunting, fishing, or extracting minerals and rocks is forbidden in parks.",
    "lnt2_trigger": "Specific Regulations in Andalusia",
    "lnt2_content": "Andalusia applies strict restrictions against forest fires. A regional government Order completely prohibits the use of fire (bonfires, barbecues, agricultural burning) from June 1 to October 15 in all Andalusian forests. During this period, vehicle traffic off paved tracks is also banned. In Andalusian natural parks, it is emphasized not to leave marked trails to protect fragile vegetation (e.g., Sierra Nevada advises 'do not leave the trails or take shortcuts'). Andalusian Law 8/2003 protects flora and fauna: it prohibits uprooting, cutting, or destroying wild plants and their habitats. In summary, in Andalusia, never collect plants or destroy ecosystems, and respect all local environmental signs.",
    "lnt3_trigger": "Sierra Nevada National Park Rules",
    "lnt3_content": "Wild camping is not permitted in this National Park. The only bivouacking allowed is overnight with prior written notification to the Park's director (maximum 15 people and 3 tents). It is forbidden to stay overnight in environmental reserve areas (e.g., 'borreguiles' or near lagoons), as well as within 500m of guarded refuges, roads, or streams. Furthermore, between June 1 and October 15, camping or bivouacking in wooded areas is not allowed due to high fire risk. In any case, within the park, it is forbidden to light fires or dump trash in springs, rivers, or the environment.",
    "lnt4_trigger": "Leave No Trace Principles",
    "lnt4_content": "Adapt the seven international principles: (1) Plan ahead and minimize waste: carry your trash (including toilet paper) to a container, avoiding waste generation. (2) Travel and camp on durable surfaces: always stay on marked trails or on hard rock; do not tread on sensitive meadows or 'borreguiles'. (3) Dispose of waste properly: bury organic waste (more than 60m from water sources) and use available services if any. (4) Leave what you find: do not leave new marks or signs; respect ruins, landscapes, and buildings. (5) Minimize campfire impacts: if fire is not strictly permitted, use them only in designated areas (fire pits) and never in summer; prefer portable stoves. (6) Respect wildlife: do not uproot plants or drive animals from their habitats. (7) Be considerate of other visitors: control noise and your passage to not disturb other hikers and the environment (e.g., speak softly and yield the way on narrow trails).",
    "etiquette_title": "Group Etiquette and Club Conduct",
    "etiquette1_title": "Respect in the Group",
    "etiquette1_content": "Be punctual and well-equipped for every outing. During the hike, adapt your pace to the one set by the guide (neither rush ahead nor fall behind). Follow the leader's instructions at all times for everyone's safety. Every member should cooperate: for example, divide responsibilities (group leader, 'flag bearers,' etc.) and look out for each other. Respectful behavior among hikers includes helping those in need and maintaining a supportive attitude on difficult terrain.",
    "etiquette2_title": "Coexistence with Other Mountaineers",
    "etiquette2_content": "On narrow trails, yield to those ascending and always walk on the right on crowded paths. Keep noise to a minimum (quiet chatter, silence in sensitive areas) and leave space at shelters and viewpoints. In accommodations or rest areas, respect turns for using facilities (kitchen, showers) and clean up thoroughly before leaving. In general, be kind to everyone: share the route with courtesy and preserve a good relationship with other mountaineers and the local environment.",
    "etiquette3_title": "Club's Commitment",
    "etiquette3_content": "Our club promotes an inclusive, safe, and respectful environment. We welcome all individuals regardless of gender, race, religion, or orientation. We encourage cooperation and mutual support on every outing. Additionally, we are committed to caring for the mountains: our activities aim for sustainable integration with nature, always prioritizing safety and environmental respect so that everyone can enjoy the trails on equal terms."
